Welcome!

Be default, you're working under the git 'main/master' branch. It is best recommended to create your own branch and merge changes.

Below are some git commands for reference:

1.) git clone <insert repo.git>   #this will clone remote repo to your local shell  
2.) git pull  ##this will ensure that you are fully syncronized with the remote branch   
3.) git branch test-branch  ##this will create a new branch called 'test-branch'
4.) git checkout test-branch  ##this will switch you from 'master' branch to the 'test-branch' 
5.) git checkout master  ##once you have completed work under 'test-branch' you can switch back to the 'master' branch 
6.) git merge
