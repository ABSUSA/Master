# Welcome!

## Be default, you're working under the git 'main/master' branch. It is best recommended to create your own branch and merge changes.

## Below are some git commands for reference:

```
1.) git clone <insert repo.git>   #this will clone remote repo to your local shell  
2.) git pull  ##this will ensure that you are fully syncronized with the remote branch   
3.) git branch test-branch  ##this will create a new branch called 'test-branch'  
4.) git add .  ##any new files / directories you created, this command will stage them so can be added  
5.) git commit -a -m "add comment here"  ##any existing files you updated, your updates will now be staged  
6.) git checkout test-branch  ##this will switch you from 'master' branch to the 'test-branch'  
7.) git checkout master  ##once you have completed work under 'test-branch' you can switch back to the 'master' branch  
8.) git merge test-branch  ##any work you completed under test-branch, those changes will now be merged to 'master' branch  
9.) git status  ##this will show you your untracked changes and your present working branch  
10) git push  ##this will push all the changes you have done to the master branch  

```
